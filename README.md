# text-editor-cpp
A text editor in C++. For GUI, I used QT Creator Community.

Editor can open existing txt files, allows user to make changes and save changes. Also editor can be opened directly from the executable, it opens an untitled blank page, which also can be "Saved As".

Also, the scripts in command-text-editor file can be compiled and run to use text editor on command prompt. Obviously, this scripts doesn't use Qt.
